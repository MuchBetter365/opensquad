# Opensquad — Project Instructions

This project uses **Opensquad**, a multi-agent orchestration framework.

## Quick Start

Type `/opensquad` to open the main menu, or use any of these commands:
- `/opensquad create` — Create a new squad
- `/opensquad run <name>` — Run a squad
- `/opensquad dashboard` — Start the live Virtual Office dashboard
- `/opensquad help` — See all commands

## Directory Structure

- `_opensquad/` — Opensquad core files (do not modify manually)
- `_opensquad/_memory/` — Persistent memory (company context, preferences)
- `squads/` — User-created squads
- `dashboard/` — Live Virtual Office app that reads squad state from `squads/`
- `squads/{name}/_investigations/` — Sherlock content investigations (profile analyses)
- `squads/{name}/output/` — Generated content and files
- `_opensquad/_browser_profile/` — Persistent browser sessions (login cookies, localStorage)

## How It Works

1. The `/opensquad` skill is the entry point for all interactions
2. The **Architect** agent creates and modifies squads
3. During squad creation, the **Sherlock** investigator can analyze reference profiles (Instagram, YouTube, Twitter/X, LinkedIn) to extract real content patterns
4. The **Pipeline Runner** executes squads automatically
5. Agents communicate via persona switching (inline) or subagents (background)
6. Checkpoints pause execution for user input/approval

## Rules

- Always use `/opensquad` commands to interact with the system
- Do not manually edit files in `_opensquad/core/` unless you know what you're doing
- Squad YAML files can be edited manually if needed, but prefer using `/opensquad edit`
- Company context in `_opensquad/_memory/company.md` is loaded for every squad run

## Jean Custom Squad Rules

When used for Jean, enforce `C:\Users\jpmcb\.codex\memories\opensquad_custom_squad_rules.md` before creating, running or showing squads.

- No decorative, static, idle or "maybe useful" agents.
- No separate Resource Controller, Resource Steward or Resource Governor agent by default.
- Replace the old resource sub-agent with `embedded_resource_guardian`, a prompt/protocol inside each active session.
- Resource state is telemetry/status/panel data, not a permanent agent card.
- Visible agents require real task/status/progress/evidence/output or blocker.
- Follow fixed limited-RAM limits and Guardian Report.

## Browser Sessions

Opensquad uses a persistent Playwright browser profile to keep you logged into social media platforms.
- Sessions are stored in `_opensquad/_browser_profile/` (gitignored, private to you)
- First time accessing a platform, you'll log in manually once
- Subsequent runs will reuse your saved session
- **Important:** The native Claude Code Playwright plugin must be disabled. Opensquad uses its own `@playwright/mcp` server configured in `.mcp.json`.
